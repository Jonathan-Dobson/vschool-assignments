                <h1>Nintendo announces a $199 Switch Lite <br> handheld video game system</h1>
                    <p>NEW YORK (CNN) — Nintendo announced it will release a smaller version of its popular Switch gaming console.</p>
                
                    <p><span class="red-text">The new Nintendo Switch Lite will cost $199.99, which is $100 less than the regular Switch model.</span> It will be released on September 20.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Adding Nintendo Switch Lite to the lineup gives gamers more color and price point options," said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a release. "Now consumers can choose the system that best suits how they like to play their favorite Nintendo Switch games."</p>
                    
                    <p>The Switch Lite is designed to be exclusively portable. That means it can't connect to the television like the Switch can. It has built-in, not removable, controllers.</p>

                <div class="line-height">
                    <p>It's slightly lighter than the Switch, weighing 0.61 pounds. It has a 5.5-inch touch screen (slightly smaller than the 6.2-inch touchscreen on the Switch) and has a slightly longer battery life. It can last up to 7 hours depending on which game is played.</p>

                    <p>The Switch Lite comes in three colors: Yellow, turquoise and gray.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nintendo notes that the Switch Lite can play games from the Switch library that "support handheld mode, although <span class="highlight">some games will have restrictions."</span> </p>

                <div class="content bottom">
                    <p>The Switch was a blockbuster for Nintendo when it launched in 2017. <u>It sold 10 million units in less than a year</u> and supply shortages made them hard to find.</p>
                    
                    <p>But sales have recently stagnated. In February, Nintendo cut its annual forecast for Switch sales from 20 million to 17 million. That suggests the device might not have the Wii-like mass appeal that Nintendo was banking on.</p>
                    
                    <p>But games for the consoles are still selling well, a sign that the Switch's popularity could prove resilient. Nintendo increased its annual outlook for sales of Switch games from 100 million to 110 million.</p>
